# API

The Census API lets you integrate core bits of Census's functionality right into your workflows. You can view information about your connections and syncs, as well as create and trigger syncs. Each endpoint returns a status field and either a data object or a single value providing context on what was requested.

Tables that include **Response Property** detail the results of the entire response. Tables that include **Data Property** detail the returned data housed in the top level `data` attribute of the response. Tables that include **Attributes** detail relevant bits of info for nested objects used in requests.
