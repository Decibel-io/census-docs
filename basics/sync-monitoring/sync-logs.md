# Warehouse Writeback

Census provides granular details on the data you've sent from your data warehouse to destination SaaS applications like Salesforce or Iterable. With these logs, you can answer common questions like:

1. When was my data updated in the destination?
2. Why did the destination's API reject records that I tried to sync?
3. What is the most common reason that the destination's API rejects my data?
4. Which users were a member of this segment at this time?

{% hint style="info" %}
Warehouse Writeback is available for Platform Plan accounts. If you would like logging enabled please contact our team at [support@getcensus.com](mailto:support@getcensus.com).
{% endhint %}

## :ballot\_box: Supported data sources

Census can provide detailed logging for all data warehouse sources:

* Snowflake
* BigQuery
* Redshift
* PostgreSQL (version 13 or later is required)
* Databricks

## üñ•Ô∏è Configuring Warehouse Writeback

To enable Warehouse Writeback on any supported source:

1. Visit the [Connections page](https://app.getcensus.com/connections).
2. Click to "Edit" the configuration of the source where you'd like logs.
3. Tick the box next to the option to "Write logs in this warehouse".

Here is an example of this configuration enabled for a sample Bigquery connection:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screely-1655474206629.png)

That's it! Logs will start populating for all syncs in this connection on their subsequent runs.

## üßÆ Log Data

#### Where can I find the logs?

Census exposes detailed logging information in a view called `sync_log` in your data warehouse. By warehouse, this view can be found as follows:

* **Snowflake**: `CENSUS.CENSUS.SYNC_LOG`
* **BigQuery:** `census.sync_log`
* **Redshift:** `census.sync_log`
* **PostgreSQL**: `census.sync_log`
* **Databricks**: `census.sync_log`

#### How much log data is stored?

Census will store the previous 7 days of logs in the `sync_log` view.

## Metadata Tables

When you enable Warehouse Writeback for a source, Census will start writing metadata about source objects and destinations involved in syncs. These tables can be joined to the `sync_log` table on their `id` column in order to add additional context.

To illustrate the value here, imagine you have a mirror sync from a segment to an ads destination. The `sync_log` table will log attempts to send new records (i.e. those that entered the segment) to the destination. It will also log attempts to delete records (i.e. those that left the segment) from the destination. If you join those logs with the source objects table (described below) you can get full insight into who is entering and leaving what segments, by name, and when.

### Source Objects Table

Source objects are tables, models, entities, or segments. These are what you send data from during a sync. Continue reading the [schema section](sync-logs.md#schema) below for more information.

#### Where

Metadata tables for source objects can be found in the following tables, by warehouse:

* **Snowflake**: `CENSUS.CENSUS.SOURCE_OBJECTS`
* **BigQuery:** `census.source_objects`
* **Redshift:** `census.source_objects`
* **PostgreSQL**: `census.source_objects`
* **Databricks**: not yet supported
