# Sync Logs

## üóÑÔ∏è What are Sync Logs?

Census can provide granular details on the data you've sent from your data warehouse to destination SaaS applications like Salesforce or Iterable. With these logs, you can answer common questions like:

1. When was my data updated in the destination?
2. Why did the destination's API reject records that I tried to sync?
3. What is the most common reason that the destination's API rejects my data?

{% hint style="warning" %}
At this time, Sync Logs are automatically accessible for Platform Plan accounts. If you would like logging enabled and are not on the Platform Plan, please contact Census Support at support@getcensus.com.

## üßÆ Log Data

#### Where can I find the logs?

Census exposes detailed logging information in a view called `sync_log` in your data warehouse. By warehouse, this view can be found as follows:

* **Snowflake**: `CENSUS.CENSUS.SYNC_LOG`
* **BigQuery:** `census.sync_log`
* **Redshift:** `census.sync_log`
* **PostgreSQL**: `census.sync_log`

#### How much log data is stored?

Census will store the previous 7 days of logs in the `sync_log` view.
