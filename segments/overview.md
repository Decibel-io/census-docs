# Overview

Census Segments lets you visually build dynamic lists of users using attributes from your models, without needing to specify SQL. This is useful to create marketing segments or audiences for Ad platforms. You can then sync those segments to any of our destinations such as FB Ads, Google Ads etc in the regular sync workflow.

Some example segments you might want to build:&#x20;

* Users who haven’t engaged with the product in the last 30 days&#x20;
* Trial users who haven’t used the product in the past week.&#x20;
* Recommend a new product to customers who have purchased a similar product
