# Overview

Census Segments lets you build dynamic lists of users using attributes from your models, without touching SQL. It makes it easy to create marketing segments or audiences, and then sync them to ad platforms, marketing automation, and more. Your segments are defined once, on your data warehouse, and can be shared with any of your Census destinations.

Here's just a few examples of Census Segments you can build:

* Users who haven’t engaged with the product in the last 30 days&#x20;
* Trial users who haven’t used the product in the past week.&#x20;
* Recommend a new product to customers who have purchased a similar product
