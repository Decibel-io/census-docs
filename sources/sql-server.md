# SQL Server

## Required Permissions

{% hint style="info" %}
These instructions are well tested to connect Census to SQL Server. If you're running into connection issues or missing tables or views, please confirm you've run all of these instructions.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Census reads data from one or more tables (possibly across different schemata) in your database and publishes it to the corresponding objects in destination tools.&#x20;

We recommend you create a dedicated `CENSUS` user account with a strong, unique password. Census uses this account to connect to your SQL Server database. In order for the Census connection to work correctly, the `CENSUS` account must have these permissions:

* Read-only access to any tables and views in any schemata that you would like Census to publish to your service destinations.

SQL Server permissions are complex and there are many ways to configure access for Census. The script below has been tested with recent SQL Server versions and is known to work correctly:

```
USE <your database>;
-- Create census user the ability to sign in with a password
CREATE LOGIN CENSUS WITH PASSWORD = '<strong, unique password>';

-- Give the census user the ability to login
CREATE USER CENSUS FOR LOGIN CENSUS;

-- Give the census user the ability to connect to database
GRANT CONNECT TO CENSUS;

-- Give the census user the ability to read all tables
EXEC sp_addrolemember 'db_datareader', CENSUS;

-- Grant census user ability to read schema and data
GRANT SELECT, VIEW DEFINITION ON SCHEMA::<your schema> TO CENSUS;
```

## ðŸ’¡ Notes

* If you have multiple schemata that you would like Census to read from, repeat the steps for "\<your schema>" for each of them
* All sync behavior will be **Read Only**, meaning that every sync will be a full sync because we do not currently support tracking sync state in MySQL
* We based our connection protocol on SQL Server [SQL JDBC driver](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/jdbc/microsoft-jdbc-driver-for-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver15)



## ðŸš¦Allowed IP Addresses

Census will always connect to your data warehouse from of these static IP addresses located within AWS:

* 34.216.163.241
* 54.212.243.205
