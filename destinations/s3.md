# S3

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Getting started

This guide shows you how to use Census to connect your S3 account to your data warehouse. This type of connection can sync data between the warehouse and your S3 bucket by mirroring data into a CSV file.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need the following:

* Census account: If you don't have this already, [start with a free trial](https://app.getcensus.com).
* S3 account: You'll need an S3 bucket that's ready for use, along with credentials for an AWS user that can write to that bucket. See AWS documentation for [setting up an S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/create-bucket-overview.html). The specific permissions Census may need are covered later in [#required-permissions](s3.md#required-permissions "mention").&#x20;
* Credentials for your data warehouse: For details, see the guide for your specific technology.
  * [Databricks](../sources/databricks.md)
  * [Google BigQuery](../sources/google-bigquery.md)
  * [Google Sheets](google-sheets.md)
  * [Postgres](../sources/postgres.md)
  * [Redshift](../sources/redshift.md)
  * [Rockset](../sources/rockset.md)
  * [Snowflake](../sources/snowflake.md)

### Step 1: Connect S3

1. Log into Census and navigate to [Connections](https://app.getcensus.com/connections).
2. Click **Add Service**.
3. Select **S3** from the dropdown list.
4. Enter a **Name** for your destination. This is only for your reference ‚Äì it can be anything that makes sense to you.
5. Enter authentication details for your AWS account and S3 bucket: **Access Key ID**, **Secret Key**, **Bucket Name**, and **AWS Region**. Census uses these details to authenticate ‚Äì they must match your AWS setup.&#x20;
6. Click **Save Connection**.

The setup will look something like this: üëá

### Step 2: Connect your data warehouse

The steps for connecting your data warehouse will depend on your technology. See the following guides:

* [Databricks](../sources/databricks.md)
* [Google BigQuery](../sources/google-bigquery.md)
* [Google Sheets](google-sheets.md)
* [Postgres](../sources/postgres.md)
* [Redshift](../sources/redshift.md)
* [Rockset](../sources/rockset.md)
* [Snowflake](../sources/snowflake.md)

After setting up your warehouse, your **Connections** page should look something like this: üëá

### Step 3: Create your model

When defining models, you'll write SQL queries to select the data you want to sync. This can be as simple as selecting everything in a specific database table or as complex as creating new calculated values.

1. From inside your Census account, navigate to the [**Models**](https://app.getcensus.com/models) page.
2. Enter a name for your model. You'll use this to select the model later.
3. Enter your SQL query. If you want to test the query, use the **Preview** button.
4. Click **Save Model**.

### Step 4: Create your first sync

The sync will move data from your warehouse to your S3 bucket. In this step, you'll define how that will work.

1. From inside your Census account, navigate to the [**Syncs**](https://app.getcensus.com/syncs) page and click **Add Sync**.
2. Under **What data do you want to sync?**, choose your data warehouse as the **Connection** and your model as the **Source**.
3. Under **Where do you want to sync data to?**, choose the name you assigned in Step 1 (we used **S3**) as the **Connection**. Enter the **File Path** for the CSV file where data will sync. The path can accept variables that will populate when the sync runs. See [File Path Variables](s3.md#file-path-variables). Confirm the file path in the **Template Preview** field.
4. Under **How should changes to the source be synced?**, **Mirror** will be automatically selected. This is the only supported sync behavior for S3.
5. Under **Which properties should be updated?**, choose whether to sync only **Selected Properties** or **Sync All Properties**. Syncing all properties will automatically add new properties to the sync if the model or database table changes.
6. To test your sync without actually syncing data, click **Run Test** and verify the results.
7. Click **Next**. This will open the **Confirm Details** page where you can see a recap of your setup.
8. If you want to start a sync immediately, set the **Run a sync now?** checkbox.
9. Click **Create Sync**.

When configuring your sync, the page should look something like this: üëá

### Step 5: Confirm the synced data

Once your sync is complete, it's time to check your data. Open your CSV file from the S3 bucket and check that the file was created or updated correctly.

If everything went well, that's it! You've started syncing data from your warehouse to S3! [ü•≥Ô∏è](https://emojikeyboard.org/copy/Partying\_Face\_Emoji\_%F0%9F%A5%B3%EF%B8%8F)

## File path variables

When defining the **File Path** for an S3 sync, you can use variables that will be set when the sync runs. This allows you to create and sync to new CSV files in the S3 bucket that reflect the date and time of the sync.

| **Variable** | **Description**              | **Example Values** |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `%Y`         | 4-digit year                 | 1997               |
| `%y`         | 2-digit year                 | 97                 |
| `%m`         | month with zero padding      | 07, 12             |
| `%-m`        | month without zero padding   | 7, 12              |
| `%d`         | day with zero padding        | 03, 23             |
| `%-d`        | day without zero padding     | 3, 23              |
| `%H`         | 24 hour with zero padding    | 08, 18             |
| `%k`         | 24 hour without zero padding | 8, 18              |
| `%I`         | 12 hour with zero padding    | 08, 12             |
| `%l`         | 12 hour without zero padding | 8, 12              |
| `%M`         | minute with zero padding     | 04, 56             |
| `%S`         | second with zero padding     | 06, 54             |

## üîÑ Supported sync behaviors

| **Behavior** | **Supported** | **Objects** |
| -----------: | :-----------: | :---------: |
|       Mirror |       ‚úÖ       |     All     |

{% hint style="info" %}
Learn about all of our sync behaviors in [Core Concepts](https://app.gitbook.com/s/-MV3poo0VqVau1o8I79\_/basics/core-concept#sync-behaviors).
{% endhint %}

[Let us know](mailto:support@getcensus.com) if you want Census to support additional sync behaviors for S3.

## üí°Things to know

* We support syncing files up to 100GB. Files larger than 5GB may require some additional permissions, see [#required-permissions](s3.md#required-permissions "mention") below.
* Data arrives in one file to the designated S3 bucket and file path.
* Files are written as a CSV with headers.
* We highly recommend adding default server-side encryption to your S3 buckets. Census supports syncing to buckets with encryption policies as long as the bucket uses an AWS provided key type like the Amazon S3 key (SSE-S3) or the AWS Key Management Service key (SSE-KMS). If the bucket uses SSE-KMS, make sure the IAM role credentials associated with the S3 connection have access to the AWS KMS key used for encryption. We do not support syncing to buckets using a customer-provided encryption key.

[Contact us](mailto:support@getcensus.com) if your use cases don't work with these limitations. We plan on addressing at least a few of these in the future!

## üîê Required permissions

For most S3 uploads, the only permission that we require is the `s3:PutObject` action.&#x20;

For files larger than 5GB, Census makes use of S3's Multi-part upload which requires the additional permissions:

* `s3:AbortMultipartUpload`
* `s3:ListMultipartUploadParts`
* `s3:ListBucketMultipartUploads`

For more details on how Multipart Uploads use these permissions, see the [S3 documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/mpuoverview.html).
