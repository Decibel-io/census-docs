[Let us know](mailto:support@getcensus.com) if you want Census to support additional sync behaviors for Google Cloud Storage.

## ðŸ’¡ Things to know

* Currently, the connector only supports syncing for files up to 5GB.
* Data arrives in one file to the designated bucket and file path.
* Files are written as a CSV with headers.

[Contact us](mailto:support@getcensus.com) if your use cases don't work with these limitations. We plan on addressing at least a few of these in the future!
