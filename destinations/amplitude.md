# Amplitude

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Getting Started

‚ÄåIn this guide, we will show you how to connect your Amplitude project to [Census](https://www.getcensus.com/) and create your first sync.

### **Prerequisites**

* [Create a Free Trial Census Account](https://app.getcensus.com/)
* Have the credential to access your warehouse. See our articles for each data warehouse
  * [Redshift](../source-warehouse/redshift.md)
  * [Snowflake](../source-warehouse/snowflake.md)
  * [Google BigQuery](../source-warehouse/google-bigquery.md)
  * [Databricks](../source-warehouse/databricks.md)
  * [Postgres](../source-warehouse/postgres.md)



### **1. Get API key from Amplitude**

Census needs only one piece of information to connect to your Amplitude project:

* The API Key for an HTTP API data source for your Amplitude project

### **2. Create a HTTP API Data Source in Amplitude, and copy the API key**

Amplitude lets you pull data from a number of different sources, including via HTTP API. If you don't have this data source set up in Amplitude already, you'll need to create one. The same steps below will also allow you to find the API key for a pre-existing HTTP API data source, as Amplitude will only permit one per project.

1. Within Amplitude‚Äôs left navigation bar, scroll down to the very bottom. **Click on Sources & Destinations.**

2. ‚ÄåOnce here, navigate to the top-right of the screen and click to **Add Data Source**. ****![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Xt-bGTekukUBgNGE-d805HzLvnODAgkuC7JCO_uiW_3gpE7-oFBID3fgEjkHfRkdlyXtEGG_wubzXWH8EBss8sJ-Ce_i9CGAnD5oy-L9F1rvn9YyQlcsxzY4ms5K8guaGWru4MlL)
3. Select **‚ÄúHTTP API‚Äù** as the type of data source, and click **Next**.![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/3oT5uRNYeOJCVX6v9h7I4zwmp0P6z2H0NTocMnaOTwauCi01GFLjVZNYdjoYLK_AxvmMVIxK-Ec8o9xDZGExO9YYlh-T2i055heRbi-VWU5B-0MsR1bDXwfOEaIkAmIr5jIokemj)
4. **Copy the API Key** \(it will be a long string of numbers and characters\), click **Next.** 
5. If you are setting up the HTTP API data source for the first time, Amplitude will require you to POST an event to their API to complete set-up. Amplitude provides instructions to send a sample event and complete set-up at this stage.
6. When the event is received by Amplitude, click **Finish** to finish setting up this source within Amplitude.

### 3. **Create the Census Connection**

Now that we have the API Key from Amplitude, we can now set up Amplitude as a Destination in Census.

1. In the **Settings** tab of Census, create a new Amplitude Service Connection. ****![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/TYNs2uji9P65wu4JR-3bU3k_0svIJ7dAdaS9I25gzHHY0U-kxlQ6twBRFPIwrUzsNGOnamNJT-8ygYqnyPsuGW51k2EGWhghMJGpur6Ewde5Rw5xaoevAyr6_CkUSZ_OiY-58b7D)
2. You can provide whatever name you like.
3. Provide the copied API Key from Amplitude.
4. Save.
